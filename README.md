# gmsh-to-vtk-CPP11
C++ 11 version of my Fortran code gmsh-to-vtk-and-tecplot

Some features:

- Object-oriented programming with modern C++ standard (C++11).

- Intensive use of the C++ standard template library. 

Remarks:

- You will need a mature C++11 compiler to compile and run my code.

- I have compiled and run my code successfully with g++ 5.1.0, Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition, Intel C++ 2018 for Linux.

- The default C++ compiler of Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (g++ 4.8.4) failed to compile my code.
